# CSI2300_FinalProject

I have created an app that can create .awl files. I am a controls engineer, and a big part of my job is programming Siemens PLCs.
The company I work for uses specific function blocks that have been proven in the past, so they don't change too much between lines/factories. 
My plan was to create app that I can use at work, but they did not want me to use anything the funtion blocks that are in use there. 
So I created simple function blocks that show the idea behind it, with code that can be easily modified after the semester is over so that it can be used. 
Currently, this code is only useable if the TIA Portal project that you are using to import the created .awl file has the funtions that I created.
But my plan is to later add a function where you can import an .awl file of each function block that will be used in the zone page, and the program will populate 
the function blocks accordingly.
The instructions on how to use the current version of the program is in the file marked Zone Builder User Manual in this repo.
